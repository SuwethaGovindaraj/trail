    "### 🧱 1. Descriptive Summary per Bucket\n",
    "- Group by volume_bucket: mean, median, std of hit_rate, dispute_ratio, recovery_rate, etc.\n",
    "- Charts:\n",
    "  - Boxplots of metrics by bucket\n",
    "  - Bar plot: providers per bucket\n",
    "  - Violin: hit_rate per bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 2. Distribution & Correlation\n",
    "- Histograms: hit_rate, dispute_ratio, recovery_rate\n",
    "- Correlation heatmap\n",
    "- Pairplot (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 3. Volume vs Performance (focus on 15+ audits)\n",
    "- Scatter: total_audits vs hit_rate\n",
    "- Scatter: total_overpay vs recovery_rate\n",
    "- Bar: avg dispute ratio by bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ 4. Risk Profiling & Outliers\n",
    "- Rule-based flags:\n",
    "  - High hit + low recovery\n",
    "  - High dispute + high overturn\n",
    "  - Low MRR\n",
    "- IQR outliers on key metrics\n",
    "- Charts:\n",
    "  - Top 10 outlier table\n",
    "  - Plotly scatter: hit_rate vs recovery_rate, color by volume_bucket\n",
